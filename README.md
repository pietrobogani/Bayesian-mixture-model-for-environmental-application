## Description
The World Health Organization considers air pollution a major global environmental risk to human health. Only in the EU in 2020, a total of 238 000 premature deaths were linked to exposure to particulate matter. Our objective is to develop Bayesian-mixture-model-based clustering algorithms for environmental applications. Specifically, we focused our attention on PM10.

## Markdown
In the files Case study.Rmd, Data exploration.Rmd and Simulations.Rmd is possible to find all the code to reproduce the analysis done and described in the report.

## Documents
In the folder [documents](https://github.com/gabrielecorbo/Bayesian-mixture-model-for-environmental-application/tree/main/documents) are located the report of the project, the final presentation exposed on 14 February 2023 and the three pdf files obtained from the Rmarkdown of the three main chapters.

## Code
The folder [code](https://github.com/gabrielecorbo/Bayesian-mixture-model-for-environmental-application/tree/main/code) contains:

- tseriesclust.R and tseriesclust_first.R, the scripts containing the 2 algortihms implemented
- include_all.R, a file that includes all the libraries and codes
- The folder [results](https://github.com/gabrielecorbo/Bayesian-mixture-model-for-environmental-application/tree/main/code/results) containing the RData of the results and a file .R with the same script of the - corresponding Rmarkdown
- The folder [simulations](https://github.com/gabrielecorbo/Bayesian-mixture-model-for-environmental-application/tree/main/code/simulations) containing the file to generate the synthetic data, a folder with the codes to check the distribution of the full conditionals and a file .R with the same script of the corresponding Rmarkdown
- The folder [data exploration](https://github.com/gabrielecorbo/Bayesian-mixture-model-for-environmental-application/tree/main/code/data%20exploration) containing two file .R with the same script of the corresponding Rmarkdown
- The folder [auxiliary_functions](https://github.com/gabrielecorbo/Bayesian-mixture-model-for-environmental-application/tree/main/code/auxiliary_functions) containing the auxiliary functions for the models.
- The folder [data](https://github.com/gabrielecorbo/Bayesian-mixture-model-for-environmental-application/tree/main/code/data) containing the datasets containing the timeseries and the stations' information.
All the code should be run setting the main folder of the repository as working directory.

## References
In the folder [references](https://github.com/gabrielecorbo/Bayesian-mixture-model-for-environmental-application/tree/main/references) are located all the references we consulted to develop the analysis.
